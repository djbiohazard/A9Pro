[Discussion on firmware change for A9 Pro headphones](https://xdaforums.com/t/firmware-change-on-a9-pro-headphones.4704191/)

They are unsure about how to proceed to apply the firmware image back into the device. 

I have a feeling this might be doable with Bluetrum Downloader as the included docx mentions:

STP_Chargebox_Y15_5632F_ZLT04_AB5682B_JD9853_HSD_20240907_(D07BA989_D8E67E57).prd and the software does export a production file like that. Might be worth looking into it.
